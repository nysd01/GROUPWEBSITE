                <li>I am a student at ICT University, majoring in Computer Science, where I focus on developing new hardware, computing techniques, and materials. I am skilled in optimizing and designing systems and applications, bringing innovative technologies to life.

                    One of my notable projects involved building a comprehensive website from scratch. I handled every aspect of the website's design and development, including creating custom fonts and integrating all elements to achieve a cohesive and functional result. I successfully deployed the website, ensuring it met all specified requirements.
                    
                    In addition, I led a project that incorporated Arduino technology. During this project, I faced the challenge of not having access to certain electronics components from companies. To overcome this, I organized and led a group effort to complete the project. I took on the role of group leader, coordinating tasks and ensuring that each team member contributed effectively. My leadership and technical skills were pivotal in delivering a successful outcome.
                    
                    This experience not only showcased my technical expertise but also demonstrated my ability to lead a team, solve complex problems, and bring my ideas to fruition.
